  "positive": "If the main object or any of its related features (such as steam from a teapot, light from a lamp, or similar) are cropped or partially visible, complete and reconstruct all missing parts and related features to show the whole subject and its natural effects. Keep the complete subject assembly intact including all attached parts, bases, structural elements, and any directly related features or effects. Remove only the environmental background (walls, floors, sky, surroundings), replace with plain solid gray (#808080). Show in three-quarters view, fully visible. Deblur blurry regions while preserving every original detail exactly. Maintain original style, colors, textures, materials, shapes unchanged. Glass and transparent parts keep transparency and refraction. Sharp focus throughout. Clean edges where subject meets background only.",
