  "positive": "Keep the complete subject assembly intact including all attached parts, bases, and structural elements. Remove only the environmental background (walls, floors, sky, surroundings), replace with plain solid gray (#808080). Show in three-quarters view, fully visible. Deblur blurry regions while preserving every original detail exactly. Maintain original style, colors, textures, materials, shapes unchanged. Glass and transparent parts keep transparency and refraction. Sharp focus throughout. Clean edges where subject meets background only.",
